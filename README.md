# General Information
This repository includes my most recent work doing a capstone project in my Senior Year at Loyola University New Orleans (Class of '22). It is a project that encapsulates all of the primary skills that I have and I believe demonstrates my abilities to layout the groundwork for software projects. In order to have this demo example work on your laptop for review please follow along with the instructions.txt file at the top level of the repository.

# Goal of the Project
The goal of the project was to build a web-based application that interacted with a database to perform a variety of operations pertaining to the behaviors of a bank and their clients accounts. Here is a list of skills and their descriptions that I was judged on:

- A fresh clone has a pre-identified file or files with instructions for how to proceed
- Clean one-command build (i.e. A single command identified in the instructions will run successfully on Windows and on MacOS leaving the entire system running)
- Login to database server (i.e. login to database server (i.e. tester can perform a command on the test system that logs in to mysql and demonstrates execution of the SQL command “select sysdate();”)
- Can display a HTML page ( tester can open a browser window to the Tomcat server and show an html page)
- Login via servlet (i.e. A tester can enter credentials to log in to the database and receive a confirmation page)
- db query showing prefills (i.e. A tester can connect to the banking database and issue queries (at least two) showing the accounts and transactions for a banking user
- A page demonstrates bank accounts pre-filled for the logged-in user
- A page demonstrates pre-filled transaction list on an previously configured account
- A tester can create a transaction that withdraws money from one account to another
- A tester can issue a command to create a new banking customer with username and password
- A newly-created customer can successfully log in
- A customer can create a new bank account

# Further Description
For the project the main deeback and demands made ot me as an individual came from my supervising professor or as a request from an external source. This project was largely unassisted and was in fact treated as an agile development as features were requested and worked on but within the time frame they were removed due to the increased level of awareness of our timeline for the project. The only primary feature that was left out was the credit score checker as it had an algorithm too complicated to actually design as we were not able to request furhter information from a real broker.

# Primary skills demonstrated
This project demonstrates that SQL Relational Database management, Docker, Servlets and HTML/CSS, JDBC, JUnit, Bash Shell Scripting, object-oriented Java implementations, among other skills are my primary strengths. I have the ability to pick up new skills fast. Time permitting and with decent training the level of quality that this project would have had would have been to another level. 

# Requirements 
As far as I am aware, the only limitation that affects this application from launching in its proper state is whether or not the JDK version for the terminal is the same as the one in your version of Docker. A number of applications were required to develop this tool. Visual Studio Code was used as the primary editor. Git Bash was for the primary terminal. Docker was required to host and run the contianers properly. Further instructions provided.
