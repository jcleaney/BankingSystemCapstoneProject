Manager of Project management Team
2/3/2022 - 3/8/2022

Basic definition: 
Project management focuses on planning and organizing a project and its resources.
This includes identifying and managing the lifecycle to be used, applying it to the user-centered design process, 
formulating the project team, and efficiently guiding the team through all phases until project completion.

What to do as a part of project management:
Project management is the process of leading the work of a team to achieve all project goals 
(the ones listed in either the google doc or the .txt file in the system) 
that have been already set as well as making new ones should you need to help guide the other teams. 
You also should set deadlines for when certain parts of the project should be completed by.
The other main part of project management is quality assurance meaning that you and your team have to make sure the system meets all 
the requirements that have been set as well as adding new requirements or getting rid of requirements. 
The last main part of project management is writing tests for the system. The way to do that is via Junit 5. 
Junit sets up a template to start testing things and looks for a boolean result so keep that in mind for creating tests.

Project manager: You are now the head of this project and you can steer it how you see fit. 
By that I mean you have meetings with your team to discuss what the other teams should be working on and towards. 
Also during these meetings you should discuss the goals and requirements of the system. You should also communicate with 
the other managers on a regular basis whether it be after class on Tues/Thurs or at the end of the week. 
You should also conduct meetings with the other managers to receive updates on how each team is doing and what has been accomplished and 
give them what they should be working on next. 
Also discussing things that Prof Wolfe might ask of you as managers.

Where the last team left off:
My team and I left off setting up several goals which are listed in both the google doc and the .txt file. 
We also started learning Junit 5 right before the mardi gras break. We were also going to set up a timeline of when things should be done; however, 
we didnâ€™t do that since Notion was not set up till right before the break.
